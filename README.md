## Tasklist

1. Literature Review
	- [ ] Technical Detail for Random Forest

2. Exploratory Analysis
	* Outcome 
		- [x] Marginal Distribution: Normal
		- [x] Outlier: Yes, a few, not too bad
	* Feature Space Structure
		- [ ] ~~Clustering (PCA/Kernel PCA?)~~
		- [ ] ~~Correlation Structure Visualization~~
		- [ ] Random Forest By-product
	* Feature - outcome Relationship
		- [ ] ~~Visualize relationship based on subsets of features/PrinComps~~
		- [ ] ~~Naive Feature Selection using SLR/Lasso.~~
		- [ ] ~~Supervised Clustering (LDA?)~~
3. Model Implementation
	1. Ridge Regression:
		- [ ] Tunning parameter selection
		- [ ] CV Prediction Error validation
	2. Random Forest:
		- [x] Forest Size/Tree Size selection (n = 1000)
		- [ ] Splitting variable selection
		- [x] CV Prediction Error validation (10-fold CV, 0.272)
